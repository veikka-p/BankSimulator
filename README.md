### Bank Simulator Project

This project is a school group effort with the aim of creating a bank ATM. The bank ATM was implemented using the C++ programming language.

The bank ATM features an SQL database responsible for managing user account information, balances, card numbers, and transactions. The database allows for the management of user account details and the execution of necessary database queries.

A JavaScript Rest API was implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The Rest API facilitated database queries.

An RFID reader was one of the hardware components of the project. It allowed for user identification and helped secure user accounts.

# My Role in the Project:

I designed the database structure and created an SQL database that stored user account details, balance changes, and transaction history.

I developed a RESTful API that enabled communication between the database and the user interface. The API provided an interface for checking account balances, updating balances, and performing other necessary operations.

I integrated the REST API into the user interface, allowing users to perform banking transactions directly at the ATM. This included displaying user account balances, processing withdrawals and deposits, and viewing transaction history.
